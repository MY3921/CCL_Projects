                <span class="yellow">While this certainly isn't the first observation of a colour-based meme creature, this is certianly the most active out of our collection. At the time of its discovery, it was observed to be completely harmless, with simply a supernatural phenomenon of curing color blindness, and appeared stationary. Only through further analysis was it discovered that it moved at the nanometer magnitude, and in infrequent increments. However, since the advent of colour television and in recent years, the internet, this meme creature has spread considerably fast, making containment progressively difficult. It has also been observed to accelerate and grow in length, and is currently moving at an approximate average of 5 m/s. Due to the speed increase, there is also a risk of causing epilespy to organic observers. We hypthosize its acceleration correlates to recent advances in color technology, though it is unknown if a regression in such technological advancements would lead to rapid decceleration.
